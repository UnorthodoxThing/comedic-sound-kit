# Comedic Sound Kit
Classic comedic sounds (with popular anime meme sounds) on the keyboard using HTML5/CSS3 and JS.

The app uses the following keyboard: `a`, `s`, `d`, `f`, `g`, `j`, `k`, `l`. Each are assigned a unique sound when pressed.

## Other Notes

The program was intended to make do with two other themed series of sounds, instead of one themed. If you look through the code, the elements were made through iterating via `for` loop. I wanted the program to be able to swap sounds later, which is why it is designed the way it is.

### Brainstorming/ Ideas
What kind of sound would you like to hear your keyboard make?
-cliche kawaii anime sound kit
-classic comedic sound kit (chosen)
-pokemon roar sound kit
-Three instruments piano-whistle-trumpet toggle to switch instrument

### Suggestions/ Improvements from previous coder (WesBos)
* Use arrays, instead of heaps of audio tags in the html file.
* Suggestions of sounds:
-laughter /
-Boo
-Drum punch line /
-Nikko Nikko
-Nyan Nyan cat /
